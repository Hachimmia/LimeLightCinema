# LimeLightCinema
Limelight Cinema is one of the projects from my last year of HND at Edinburgh College, which finished in 2023. 
The website is for a Cinema in Scotland, to show all the movies that are currently playing and also with booking and account systems.

I had to do all the research about the topic, demographic, and competitors as well as all the technical and design documentation: Analysis of the brief, User analysis, target audience, project plan, and task analysis.
For the Design documentation, I made a navigation map, computer view and mobile view wireframes, style guide, logo, high-fidelity wireframe and storyboards. I had some design implications to respect, so I created two different styles for junior members and adult members.

The website has this feature built-in:
- The website must have an admin panel, where the admin can add delete and update films and members of the cinema. Only the admin can have access to them.
- Adult members can book films and can see every type of films
- Junior members cannot book films and can see only junior films on the website
- Admin can access all pages
- Different and appealing design for both kinds of members. 
- Displaying Dynamic content
- booking system
- Register system
- Login/logout system
- People need to be members of the website to have access to see films

For building the website I used:
- HTML
- SASS
- CSS
- PHP
- mySQL
- SQL
- JavaScript
- npm
- Bootstrap 5.3
- Session
- Swiper
- AOS

Software:
- Visual Studio Code
- phpMyAdmin
- XAMPP
- FileZilla
- Adobe XD
- Adobe Illustrator
- Click-up (for planning)
- Some websites for testing my website
